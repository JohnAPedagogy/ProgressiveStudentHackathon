# Summer 2021 Digial Software Hackathon - Round One
Welcome to Round 1 of the Summer 2021 Digital Software Hackathon.  This is the elimination round of the hackathon.  This means that only when you have completed the tasks in this section will you be able to compete in the main round which is the Hackathon.  In the first round you will be building an admin console. You will complete a series of tutorial videos where you will learn the technology stack listed, and then apply the knowledge to complete the admin console.  The admin console will have the ability to add, edit, list, view and delete different entities which you will be assigned.  The technology stack comprise the following software programming tools and frameworks:
1. Git
2. HTML
3. CSS
4. Bootstrap
5. Javascript/Typescript
6. Angular

Not to worry if you haven't used these before, you will get all the support you need to learn them through the daily sessoins and even if you don't complete the tasks within the first week; whenever you complete the elimination round, you will then be upgraded to the main hackathon round.  So please put in the effort to learn these technologies and complete the tasks.  You have been given tutorial videos in advance of the sessions, so you can complete the tasks ahead of time.
