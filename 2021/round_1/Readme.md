# Summer 2021 Digial Software Hackathon
Welcome to Round 1 of the Summer 2021 Digital Software Hackathon.  This is the elimination round of the hackathon.  This means that only when you have completed the tasks in this section will you be able to compete in the main round which is the Hackathon.  In the first round you will be building a admin console. You will complete a series of tutorial classes where you will learn the technology stack listed, and then apply the knowledge to complete the admin console.  The admin consile will have the ability to add, edit, list, view and delete different entities you will be assigned.  The technology stack is as follows:
1. Git
2. HTML
3. CSS
4. Javascript/Typescript
5. Angular

Not to worry about these, you will get all the support you need to learn them and even if you don't complete this within the first week.  Whenever you complete this task, you will then be allowed to join the main hackathon round.  So please put in the effort to learn these technologies and complete the tasks.  You will be given tutorial videos in advance of the sessions, so you can complete the tasks ahead of time.
