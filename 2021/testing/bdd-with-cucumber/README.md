# BDD with Cucumber - Video Scripts

This repo contains the scripts and other artefacts used to generate the *BDD with Cucumber* Courses for Java, Ruby and JavaScript hosted at https://school.cucumber.io

Video and audio assets are stored on Google Drive, [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1UevNOmYoxXFosSrg_wxfretQmJxunjv4).

## Reading the scripts

The scripts can be read [here](https://cucumber-school.github.io/bdd-with-cucumber/) as HTML pages generated by AsciiDoc from the source files in this repository. The pages are built by a [GitHub action](https://github.com/cucumber-school/bdd-with-cucumber/blob/master/.github/workflows/html.yml) and hosted on GitHub pages.

## Generating the script HTML

To work on the scripts locally, you'll need to install Ruby and Bundler.

To compile the project into a set of HTML files, run the following command:

```
  bundle exec rake
```

This will produce an html file under `public/index.<language>.html` for each available language, and a `public/index.html` to navigate to them.

You can list all available languages with:

```
  bundle exec rake list
```

To compile only the files for a specific language, you can pass an argument to the `html` rake task, like this:

```
  bundle exec rake html[ruby]
```

### Continuous build

You can use Guard together with a [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/) plugin for your browser to automatically re-generate and refresh the HTML in your browser.

```
  bundle exec guard
```

### Working on code storyboard branches

The source code for most of the chapters is kept in on [orphan branches](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout/1.7.3.1#git-checkout---orphan) named after the chapter and language, e.g. [`chapter-03-code-ruby`](https://github.com/cucumber-school/bdd-with-cucumber/commits/chapter-03-code-ruby)

The idea is to create a storyboard for the code in the chapter in the branch, with one commit each time something happens. To create a new chapter code branch, use these commands:

    git checkout --orphan chapter-0n-code-<lang> # where n is the chapter number and <lang> is the language
    rm -rf . # because otherwise all the files you just had in HEAD will get checked in!
    echo "content\npublic\n" > .gitignore
    git add --all
    git commit -m "Initial commit"

Now you can work on the storyboard. If you mess something up, use `git rebase` to fix it:

    git rebase -i --root

This will show you all the commits in the branch, and you can go back and rewrite history until you have something you're happy with.

### Unrolling storyboards into your branch

Once you have your storyboard, you can unroll each of the commits from the storyboard into a `content/<chapter>/code/<language>`
folder, allowing you to include snippets of the code in the AsciiDoc script.

To unroll the storyboard branches, run this command:

    bundle exec rake code

Or only for a specific language:

    bundle exec rake code[ruby]

Don't forget to push your storyboard branch too!

    git push --force chapter-0n-code-<lang>

There is a [check](https://github.com/cucumber-school/bdd-with-cucumber/blob/master/.github/workflows/html.yml#L26) in the GitHub actions build script which should warn you if you forgot to push your storyboard branch and the unrolled commits are out of step with the branch.

### Workflow tip: iterating between storyboard and script

Sometimes you want to work on the code and the script at the same time. It's a hassle to keep switching
branches in this situation. A good tip is to use `git worktree`, like this:

````
git worktree add <new-path-for-worktree> <branch-to-work-on-in-worktree>
````

The `new-path-for-worktree` should be **outside** the existing git repo.

You can work on the code branch in the `worktree` branch, and the script on `master`. When you've made commits to the worktree, they will be reflected in the repo. Then you can run `rake code` to unroll the latest commits and make them available to your script.

Once you have committed your code changes, it's safe to remove the worktree:

````
git worktree remove <new-path-for-worktree>
````

When everything is done, push *both branches* (master and your code branch) to GitHub. You may need to force push the code branch.
