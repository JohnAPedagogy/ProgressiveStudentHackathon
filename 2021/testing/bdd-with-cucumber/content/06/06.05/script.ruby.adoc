shot::[1, show HTML output]
In the last lesson we saw the output generated by the HTML plugin. This is a great way for your business colleagues and customers to engage with the development of the product. Since the scenarios are written in business language, they act as documentation that everyone interested in the product can understand. And, because the results are colour-coded green (if the system behaves as expected) or red (if it doesn't) everyone can see what behaviour has been implemented.

The challenge is making sure that this documentation is easily available. Feature files are usually checked into source control along with the source code, which isn't a great way of making it accessible to less technical team members. The HTML output can be shared, but it needs to be stored somewhere that everyone has access to - such as on your intranet or wiki. That's something that your team has to configure themselves.

Since Cucumber 6.0.0 there has been a new feature that allows you to automatically publish the results online to a free service called Cucumber Reports. shot::[2, go to reports.cucumber.io]

Ensure that you're using Cucumber 6.0.0 or later shot::[3, show package-lock.json file]

.Gemfile.lock
[source,json]
----
    cucumber (6.0.0)
----

and remove publish-quiet from `cucumber.yml`. shot::[4, cucumber.js]

.cucumber.yml
[source,yaml]
----
default: --order random
----

Now when we run Cucumber, shot::[5, "npm test"] it helpfully prints out a banner telling you how to publish your results to Cucumber Reports shot::[6, highlight banner, ART: Highlight this in post].

Let's follow the instructions in the banner and add --publish to cucumber.js shot::[7].

.cucumber.yml
[source, yaml]
----
default: --publish --order random
----

Now we can run Cucumber again and we get a different banner output shot::[8]. The unique URL in this banner is the address of your published report shot::[9, highlight URL].

shot::[10, follow URL]
Open the URL and you'll find your report published in the same format as the HTML plugin. Now you can share the report just by sharing the URL. You also get some extra information about the run that generated the report. If you publish reports from a recognised CI server, then extra information is gathered.

You might have noticed the warning in the banner that says the report will "self-destruct". shot::[12, highlight warning] To prevent a report from being deleted, it has to be associated with an authenticated account.

Follow the link in the report to authenticate your account shot::[13]shot::[14] You can then retrieve your Cucumber Reports publish token shot::[15]. Reports associated with a publish token will be kept until explicitly deleted.

shot::[16,"publish quiet"]
During development you probably won't want to publish a report after every build... and you might prefer not to see the banner output telling you about Cucumber Reports. Let's fix this in cucumber.js by replacing --publish with --publish-quiet:

.cucumber.yml
[source, yaml]
----
default: --publish-quiet --order random
----

shot::[17, "no banner"]
Now when we run Cucumber, no report is published and no banner advertising Cucumber Reports is output.

Cucumber Reports is under active development, so expect to see many more useful features coming in the coming months.
