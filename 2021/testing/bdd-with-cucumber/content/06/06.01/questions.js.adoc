==== Lesson 1 - Questions

===== Which option flag sets a regular expression that Cucumber uses to filter the scenarios run by name?

* --regex
* --name    -----TRUE
* --filter
* --name-regex

Explanation:
You can find a list of supported Cucumber options by running `cucumber-js --help` or `npm test -- --help`

===== What are the benefits of using cucumber.js rather than the command line to set system properties?  **MULTIPLE-CHOICE**

* You can check cucumber.js into source control    -----TRUE
* The options set in the cucumber.js will be used no matter how you invoke Cucumber    -----TRUE
* Using cucumber.js is the only way to set options when using `npm`    -----FALSE

Explanation:
Because cucumber.js is a file that lives within the project, it can be checked into source control and it can be accessed by the Cucumber integration implemented by your IDE.

System properties can also be set on the command line (even when you are using npm) or by using environment variables.
