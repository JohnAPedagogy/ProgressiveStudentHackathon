==== Lesson 3 - Questions

===== What is a feature file _description_?

* Any lines of text between the feature name and the first rule or scenario - TRUE
* A line of text that starts with the `#` character
* A block of text introduced by the `Description:` keyword

Answer: You can add a free text description of a feature file after the `Feature:` line that defines the feature's name. The description can be any number of lines long. The description continues until the first rule, scenario, or scenario outline is encountered.

===== What is the purpose of writing an empty scenario?

* It is not valid Gherkin syntax to write an empty scenario
* Empty scenarios act as a reminder that we have more work to do - TRUE
* Empty scenarios are a way of pretending that we have done more work than we actually have

Answer: Cucumber treats empty scenarios as work that needs to be done and reports them as _pending_.
