In the last lesson we took a break from the code to sharpen up your skills with Cucumber’s command-line interface.

Now it’s time to dive right back into the code. We’re going to explore one of the hottest topics that teams come across when they start to get to grips with Cucumber and BDD: how much detail to use in your scenarios.

Many teams find they can’t easily agree on this. It can often seem like a matter of personal preference. It’s true there are no right and wrong answers, but we’re going to teach you some heuristics you can apply to help you make better decisions.
