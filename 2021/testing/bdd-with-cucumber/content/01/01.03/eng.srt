0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:04,372
Let's imagine we're building a
point-of-sale system for an electronics retailer

2
0:00:04,372 --> 0:00:05,976
Dixies

3
0:00:06,192 --> 0:00:08,192
Here's our next user story!

4
0:00:08,192 --> 0:00:09,592
Process Refunds

5
0:00:09,592 --> 0:00:12,272
In order to satisfy
customers statutory rights

6
0:00:12,272 --> 0:00:16,383
As a sales assistant
I need to be able to process refunds

7
0:00:17,663 --> 0:00:21,522
In order to prepare this story for
development we have what we call

8
0:00:21,522 --> 0:00:23,807
a three amigos meeting

9
0:00:24,319 --> 0:00:26,922
We call it the three amigos
because it involves

10
0:00:26,922 --> 0:00:29,183
three different disciplines from the team

11
0:00:29,812 --> 0:00:31,312
Test

12
0:00:31,312 --> 0:00:32,672
Development

13
0:00:32,672 --> 0:00:34,447
and Product

14
0:00:34,927 --> 0:00:36,863
Let's watch one in action

15
0:00:37,572 --> 0:00:40,252
The business rules to this story
are really simple

16
0:00:40,252 --> 0:00:45,092
Any item can be returned within 14 days
as long as the customer has a receipt

17
0:00:45,092 --> 0:00:46,732
Can you give me an example?

18
0:00:46,732 --> 0:00:47,552
Okay

19
0:00:47,552 --> 0:00:51,052
Collin the customer bought
a kettle last week from us

20
0:00:51,052 --> 0:00:54,252
When he got home he realised the colour
didn't match his kitchen cabinets

21
0:00:54,252 --> 0:00:56,292
and he really didn't like it

22
0:00:56,292 --> 0:00:59,992
Um, he's brought it back to
the store for refund

23
0:00:59,992 --> 0:01:02,722
He walks up to Sally
a junior sales assistant

24
0:01:02,722 --> 0:01:06,172
and he asks her to process the refund

25
0:01:06,172 --> 0:01:09,312
What's the outcome here?
What are we supposed to test?

26
0:01:09,312 --> 0:01:14,272
Well we need to increment the
stock quantity for that item

27
0:01:14,272 --> 0:01:17,012
so we know it's back in our inventory

28
0:01:17,012 --> 0:01:18,472
Ah right, anything else?

29
0:01:18,472 --> 0:01:21,452
No, no, I think that's all

30
0:01:21,452 --> 0:01:24,072
What if Collin doesn't have his receipt?

31
0:01:24,072 --> 0:01:26,092
Does Sally have to send him home?

32
0:01:26,092 --> 0:01:30,972
Well, a manager can process a refund
with any proof of purchase

33
0:01:30,972 --> 0:01:34,152
Collin could use a bank statement
for example?

34
0:01:34,152 --> 0:01:38,432
But Sally can't do that so
she would have to ask her boss

35
0:01:38,432 --> 0:01:40,472
Right, so there are two rules here:

36
0:01:40,472 --> 0:01:43,932
The customer must have
proof of purchase, not just a receipt

37
0:01:43,932 --> 0:01:45,812
and if they don't have their receipt

38
0:01:45,812 --> 0:01:48,332
then it must be authorized
by a manager, right?

39
0:01:48,332 --> 0:01:50,492
Oh, oh right! Exactly!

40
0:01:50,492 --> 0:01:53,012
Aren't we forgetting something here?

41
0:01:53,592 --> 0:01:55,712
Isn't Collin supposed to get his money back?

42
0:01:56,292 --> 0:01:59,112
Oh! Uh, oh yes of course!

43
0:01:59,112 --> 0:02:02,592
And does the system need to notify
anyone in the warehouse to

44
0:02:02,592 --> 0:02:04,072
come pick up the kettle?

45
0:02:04,072 --> 0:02:05,192
Good idea, Tammy.

46
0:02:05,192 --> 0:02:09,532
Yes, I think that's out of our scope
for this version of the story

47
0:02:09,532 --> 0:02:12,412
but I'll put it on the
backlog for future iteration
