0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:03,800
Once all three amigos are happy
that they understand the story

2
0:00:03,800 --> 0:00:07,940
then you can start translating your
examples into something that
Cucumber can understand

3
0:00:09,480 --> 0:00:12,500
Here's one of our examples
written out in Gherkin

4
0:00:12,500 --> 0:00:14,860
the specification language for Cucumber

5
0:00:17,280 --> 0:00:18,680
As you can see

6
0:00:18,680 --> 0:00:21,200
Gherkin's almost like plain English

7
0:00:21,200 --> 0:00:26,460
We have to use a few special key words
so that Cucumber can understand it, too

8
0:00:26,460 --> 0:00:31,500
Words like Feature, Scenario,
Given, When, and Then

9
0:00:31,500 --> 0:00:33,420
You'll learn all about these soon

10
0:00:34,920 --> 0:00:39,180
We can refine as many examples
as we need into this form

11
0:00:39,180 --> 0:00:43,520
to create an executable specification
for our software

12
0:00:44,200 --> 0:00:45,700
In the next lesson

13
0:00:45,700 --> 0:00:49,050
you'll learn how to create
your first Cucumber scenario

14
0:00:49,060 --> 0:00:50,400
and execute it
