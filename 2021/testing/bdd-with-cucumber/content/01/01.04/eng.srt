1
0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:01,320
As you can see

2
0:00:01,320 --> 0:00:04,000
the three amigos meeting
raises lots of questions

3
0:00:04,700 --> 0:00:09,560
It's a really useful way to discover
assumptions and potential misunderstandings

4
0:00:09,560 --> 0:00:11,480
It is also a great way to communicate

5
0:00:11,480 --> 0:00:14,491
requirements that somebody
might have thought about

6
0:00:14,500 --> 0:00:17,820
but never explained clearly to
other people on the team

7
0:00:18,480 --> 0:00:21,720
Sometimes the three amigos will hit
a question that nobody in the room

8
0:00:21,720 --> 0:00:23,680
knows the answer to

9
0:00:23,680 --> 0:00:26,680
These are also a valuable output
from the meeting

10
0:00:26,680 --> 0:00:30,880
Now you have a clear picture
of what you know and

11
0:00:30,880 --> 0:00:32,240
what you need to find out

12
0:00:34,040 --> 0:00:35,580
Talking through examples
is a great way

13
0:00:35,580 --> 0:00:38,680
to get everyone on the same page
about what needs to be built
