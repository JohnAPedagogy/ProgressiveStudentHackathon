0:00:00,056 --> 0:00:02,400
A prerequisite for doing BDD

2
0:00:02,401 --> 0:00:05,176
is to have an agile process in place

3
0:00:06,200 --> 0:00:10,998
BBD needs to be done just in time
at the last responsible moment

4
0:00:11,000 --> 0:00:14,320
because we place a lot of emphasis
on conversations rather than trying to

5
0:00:14,320 --> 0:00:15,680
write everything down

6
0:00:16,660 --> 0:00:19,940
If you try to have those conversations
too far ahead of doing the work

7
0:00:19,951 --> 0:00:22,584
you'll have forgotten most of
what you talked about

8
0:00:24,376 --> 0:00:28,472
So you need to have your work already
broken down into user stories

9
0:00:28,728 --> 0:00:32,568
Ideally, you'll have also started to
define acceptance criteria

10
0:00:32,569 --> 0:00:34,616
or business rules for those stories

11
0:00:35,617 --> 0:00:37,400
But they don't need
to be exhaustive yet

12
0:00:37,400 --> 0:00:40,248
we'll flesh them out during
the BBD process
