=== Flexibility

Although it's important to try to use consistent terminology in our Gherkin scenarios to help develop the ubiquitous language of your domain, we also want scenarios to read naturally, which sometimes means allowing a bit of flexibility.

Ideally, the language used in scenarios should never be constrained by your step definitions. Otherwise they'll end up sounding like they were written by robots. Or worse, they read like code.
