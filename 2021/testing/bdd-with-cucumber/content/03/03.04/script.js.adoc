One common example is the problem of plurals. Suppose we want to place Lucy and Sean just 1 metre apart: shot::[1]

[source, gherkin]
----
    ​Given Lucy is located 1 metre from Sean
----

Because we’ve used the singular `metre` instead of the plural `metres` we don't get a match: shot::[2]

U-U

Failures:

1) Scenario: Listener is within range # features/hear_shout.feature:2
   ? Given Lucy is located 1 metre from Sean
       Undefined. Implement with the following snippet:

         Given('Lucy is located {int} metre from Sean', function (int) {
         // Given('Lucy is located {float} metre from Sean', function (float) {
           // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
           return 'pending';
         });
       
   - When Sean shouts "free bagels at Sean's" # features/step_definitions/steps.js:10
   ? Then Lucy hears Sean's message
       Undefined. Implement with the following snippet:

         Then('Lucy hears Sean\'s message', function () {
           // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
           return 'pending';
         });

What a pain!

Fear not. We can just surround the `s` in parentheses to make it optional, like this: shot::[3]
[]

include::../code/js/04-matching-1-metre-/features/step_definitions/steps.js[lines=3..3]

shot::[4]
Now our step matches:

Lucy is 100 centimetres from Sean

This is one way to smooth off some of the rough edges in your cucumber expressions, and allow your scenarios to be as expressive as possible.

Another is to allow _alternates_ - different ways of saying the same thing. For example, to accept this step: shot::[5]

[source, gherkin]
----
    ​Given Lucy is standing 1 metre from Sean
----

...we can use this Cucumber Expression: shot::[6]
[source, js]
----
include::../code/js/05-matching-located-and-standing/features/step_definitions/steps.js[lines=3..3]
----

shot::[7]
Now we can use either 'standing' or 'located' in our scenarios, and both will match just fine:
