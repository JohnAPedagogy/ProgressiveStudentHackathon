One common example is the problem of plurals. Suppose we want to place Lucy and Sean just 1 metre apart:

[source, gherkin]
----
include::../code/ruby/05-use-singular-metre/features/hear_shout.feature[lines=3..3]
----

shot::[2]
Because weâ€™ve used the singular `metre` instead of the plural `metres` we don't get a match:

[source]
----
$ bundle exec cucumber
Feature: Hear shout

  Scenario: Listener is within range         # features/hear_shout.feature:2
    Given Lucy is located 1 metre from Sean  # features/hear_shout.feature:3
    When Sean shouts "free bagels at Sean's" # features/step_definitions/steps.rb:8
    Then Lucy hears Sean's message           # features/step_definitions/steps.rb:13

1 scenario (1 undefined)
3 steps (2 skipped, 1 undefined)
0m0.017s

You can implement step definitions for undefined steps with these snippets:

Given("Lucy is located {int} metre from Sean") do |int|
  pending # Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
end
----

What a pain!

Fear not. We can just surround the `s` in parentheses to make it optional, like this: shot::[3]

[source, ruby]
----
include::../code/ruby/06-allow-for-singular-or-plural-metres/features/step_definitions/steps.rb[lines=3..3]
----

shot::[4]
Now our step matches:

[source]
----
$ bundle exec cucumber
Feature: Hear shout

  Scenario: Listener is within range         # features/hear_shout.feature:2
    Given Lucy is located 1 metre from Sean  # features/step_definitions/steps.rb:3
      Lucy is 100 centimetres from Sean (Cucumber::Pending)
      ./features/step_definitions/steps.rb:5:in `"Lucy is located {int} metre(s) from Sean"'
      features/hear_shout.feature:3:in `Given Lucy is located 1 metre from Sean'
    When Sean shouts "free bagels at Sean's" # features/step_definitions/steps.rb:8
    Then Lucy hears Sean's message           # features/step_definitions/steps.rb:13

1 scenario (1 pending)
3 steps (2 skipped, 1 pending)

This is one way to smooth off some of the rough edges in your cucumber expressions, and allow your scenarios to be as expressive as possible.

Another is to allow _alternates_ - different ways of saying the same thing. For example, to accept this step: shot::[5]

[source, gherkin]
----
include::../code/ruby/07-allow-standing-or-located-as-alternates/features/hear_shout.feature[lines=3..3]
----

...we can use this Cucumber Expression: shot::[6]
[source, ruby]
----
include::../code/ruby/07-allow-standing-or-located-as-alternates/features/step_definitions/steps.rb[lines=3..3]
----

shot::[7]
Now we can use either 'standing' or 'located' in our scenarios, and both will match just fine:

[source]
----
$ bundle exec cucumber
Feature: Hear shout

  Scenario: Listener is within range         # features/hear_shout.feature:2
    Given Lucy is standing 1 metre from Sean # features/step_definitions/steps.rb:3
      Lucy is 100 centimetres from Sean (Cucumber::Pending)
      ./features/step_definitions/steps.rb:5:in `"Lucy is located/standing {int} metre(s) from Sean"'
      features/hear_shout.feature:3:in `Given Lucy is standing 1 metre from Sean'
    When Sean shouts "free bagels at Sean's" # features/step_definitions/steps.rb:8
    Then Lucy hears Sean's message           # features/step_definitions/steps.rb:13

1 scenario (1 pending)
3 steps (2 skipped, 1 pending)
