===== Which of the following Cucumber Expressions will match the step "Given Lucy is 15 metres from Sean"?

* "lucy is 15 metres from sean" - FALSE
* "Given Lucy is 15 metres from Sean" - FALSE
* "Lucy is 15 metres from Sean" - TRUE

Answer: Cucumber Expressions look for a match of the whole step text EXCLUDING the Gherkin keyword (Given/When/Then/And/But). The match is case sensitive and matches whitespace as well.
