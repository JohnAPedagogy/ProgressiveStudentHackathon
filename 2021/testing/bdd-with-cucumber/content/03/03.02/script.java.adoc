Let's look at the Shouty scenario from the last chapter. shot::[1]

.hear_shout.feature

include::../code/java/01--step01-literal-match/shouty/src/test/resources/shouty/hear_shout.feature[lines=1..6]

As Cucumber starts to execute this feature, it will come to the first step of the scenario `Given Lucy is located 15 metres from Sean` shot::[2] and say to itself "now - do I have any step definitions that match the phrase `Lucy is located 15 metres from Sean`?”"

shot::[3]
The most simple cucumber expression that would match that step is this one:

----
Lucy is located 15 metres from Sean
----

That’s pretty simple isn't it? Cucumber expressions are just string patterns, and the most simple pattern you can use is a perfect match.

In Java, we can use this pattern to make a step definition like this: shot::[4]

We use a normal Java string to pass the cucumber expression to Cucumber.
