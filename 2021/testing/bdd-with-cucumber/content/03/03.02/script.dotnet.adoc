Let's look at the Shouty scenario from the last chapter. shot::[1, "initial zoom 150%"]

.HearShout.feature

As SpecFlow starts to execute this feature, it will come to the first step of the scenario `Given Lucy is located 15 metres from Sean` shot::[2] and say to itself "now - do I have any step definitions that match the phrase `Lucy is located 15 metres from Sean`?"

shot::[3, "new text file, zoom 200%, full screen, make text left aligned in line 7"]
The most simple cucumber expression that would match that step is this one:

----
Lucy is located 15 metres from Sean
----

Thatâ€™s pretty simple isn't it? Cucumber expressions are just string patterns, and the most simple pattern you can use is a perfect match.

In C#, we can use this pattern to make a step definition like this: shot::[4]

We use a normal C# string to pass the cucumber expression to SpecFlow.
