The easiest way to get started with Cucumber for Java is to use a template
project with a build script that sets everything up correctly.

shot::[1]
You can download this template project from GitHub. Open your web browser and go
to the “Cucumber Java Skeleton” project on GitHub.

If you’re comfortable with Git you can just clone the project.

If you’re new to Git, don’t worry, we’ll download a zip file instead. Click
Releases,shot::[2] then download the most recent zip file that starts with a “v”.shot::[3]

// If you’re on Windows, click the zip file to download it. If you’re on “OS ten”
// or Linux, just copy the link and download it with “wget”.

shot::[4]
On Windows, extract the zip file by double clicking on it. -Or if you’re on OS
ten or Linux, extract it with the unzip command.

[source,bash]
----
$ unzip cucumber-java-skeleton-<VERSION>.zip
----

shot::[5]
After extracting the zip file, we’ll rename the directory to “shouty”.

[source,bash]
----
$ mv cucumber-java-skeleton-<VERSION> shouty
----

shot::[6]
In your shell, cd into the shouty directory.

The template project contains Maven and Ant build scripts that makes it easier
to get started with Cucumber for Java.

We’ll be using Maven, so if you haven’t installed that already, now is a good time to do that.

shot::[7]
Let’s take a look at what else is in this project.

[source,bash]

17 directories, 14 files

There is a main directory for our application code,shot::[8] and a test directory for our test code.shot::[9]
Let’s remove some of the files that come with the project.

Remove `Belly.java`,shot::[10] `StepDefinitions.java` shot::[11] and `belly.feature`.shot::[12]

[source,bash]
----
$ rm src/main/java/io/cucumber/skeleton/Belly.java
$ rm src/test/java/io/cucumber/skeleton/StepDefinitions.java
$ rm src/test/resources/io/cucumber/skeleton/belly.feature

shot::[13]
Now we have a bare bones project. We’ll be building it from the ground up so you can see what is going on.

Before we open the project in our IDE we are going to modify the name of the
application.

shot::[14]
Open pom.xml and change the group ID, shot::[15] artifact ID shot::[16] and name. shot::[17]

[source,xml]
----
<project ...>
    ...
    
    <groupId>cucumber-school</groupId>
    <artifactId>shouty</artifactId>
    <version>0.0.1</version>
    <packaging>jar</packaging>
    <name>Shouty</name>
    
    ...
</project>

// NOTE: You can see a bar on the lower part of the screen in this shot, maybe ARTHUR can remove it while editing. I also left a screenshot of IntelliJ's splashscreen in case we want to show that

We are ready to start coding! We are going to use IntelliJ IDEA Community
Edition because it has really nice Cucumber integration built-in. If you prefer
to use a different IDE such as Eclipse, that is fine too.

shot::[19]
To open the project in InteliJ, just open the pom.xml file.

shot::[20]
Before we create any files, let’s rename the package from skeleton to shouty. In
InteliJ you can rename it via the Refactor menu.

Now we’re ready to create our first feature file.
