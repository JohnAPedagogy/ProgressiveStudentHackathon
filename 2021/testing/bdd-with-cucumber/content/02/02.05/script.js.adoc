Now that we have the step definitions matching, we can start working on our solution. We like to use our scenarios to _guide_ our development, so we'll start designing the objects we'll need by sketching out some code in our step definitions.

The scenario will be failing while we do this, but we should see the error messages gradually progressing as we drive out the interface to our object model.

Our next goal is for the scenario to fail because we need to implement the actual business logic. _Then_ we can work on changing the business logic inside our objects to make it pass.

.steps.js

include::../code/js/05-output-stepdef-argument-to-console/features/step_definitions/steps.js[]

To implement the first step, we need to create a couple of `Person` objects,shot::[2] with the specified distance between them. shot::[3] We can remove the `pending` status now,shot::[4] and this `console.log` statement,shot::[5] and write the implementation for the first step like this:

.steps.js
[source,js]
----
include::../code/js/06-person-undefined/features/step_definitions/steps.js[lines=3..7]
----

We have two instances of person, one representing Lucy, shot::[6]and one representing Sean. shot::[7]Then we call a method to move Lucy to the position specified in the scenario.shot::[8]

shot::[9, "02.05.animation.mp4"]

To keep things simple, we're going to assume all people are situated on a line: a one-dimensional co-ordinate system. We can always introduce proper geo-locations later. We'll place Sean in the centre, and Lucy 15 metres away from Sean.

This might not be the design we'll end up with once this is all working, but it's a decent place to start.

shot::[10]
If we run Cucumber, we’ll see a compilation error from JavaScript: we need to define our `Person` class.shot::[11]

We're making progress! 

We'll keep working like this until we see the scenario failing for the right reasons.

In the second step definition, we want to tell Sean to shout something.

shot::[22]
In order to send instructions to Sean, we need to store him in an property, which we already have, so that he’ll be accessible from all of our step definitions.

shot::[23]
In the `When` step, we're capturing Sean's message using the `{string}` pattern, and pass an argument to the function. shot::[24] We'll call it `message`.shot::[25]

shot::[26]
And now we can now tell him to _shout_ the message:

shot::[30]
The last step definition is where we implement a check, or assertion. We’ll verify that what Lucy has heard is exactly the same as what Sean shouted.

shot::[31]
Once again we’re are going to write the code we wish we had.

But before, we need to import `assertThat` shot::[32] and `is` shot::[33] from `hamjest`shot::[34]

[source,js]

include::../code/js/10-add-assertions-and-person-messagesheard/features/step_definitions/steps.js[lines=1..1]

//...

include::../code/js/10-add-assertions-and-person-messagesheard/features/step_definitions/steps.js[lines=16..18]
----

So we need a way to ask Lucy what messages she’s heard, and we also need to know what it was that Sean shouted.

shot::[35]
We can record what Sean shouts by storing it in the `this.message` property as the `When` step runs. This is a common pattern to use in Cucumber step definitions when you don’t want to repeat the same test data in different parts of a scenario. Now we can use that in the assertion check.

[source,js]
----
include::../code/js/10-add-assertions-and-person-messagesheard/features/step_definitions/steps.js[lines=10..14]
----

shot::[36]
We also need to add a `messagesHeard` method to our Person class. Let’s do that now, we'll just return an empty array for now shot::[37]

This is great! Whenever we do BDD, getting to our first failing test is a milestone. Seeing the test fail proves that it is capable of detecting errors in our code!

Never trust an automated test that you haven’t seen fail!

Now all we have to do is write the code to make it do what it's supposed to.
