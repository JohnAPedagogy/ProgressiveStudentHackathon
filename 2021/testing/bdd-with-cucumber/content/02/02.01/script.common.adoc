=== An introduction to Shouty

Shouty is a social network that allows people who are physically close to communicate, just like people have always communicated with their voices. In the real world you can talk to someone in the same room, or across the street. Or even 100 m away from you in a park - if you shout.

That’s Shouty. What you say on this social network can only be “heard” by people who are nearby.
