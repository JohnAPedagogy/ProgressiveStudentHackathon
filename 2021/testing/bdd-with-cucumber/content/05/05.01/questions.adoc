==== Lesson 1 - Questions

===== Why was it a good idea to delete the scenario?

* It doesn't help illustrate the rule "Shouts can be heard by other users" -- TRUE
* No one should give away free coffee
* There should only be one scenario per rule

Explanation:
We created the scenario "Listener hears a different message" to force us to replace our hard-coded implementation. Now we have a domain model that uses a variable for the message, there's an insignificant chance of this behaviour regressing, so we can safely remove the second scenario.

Keeping excess scenarios is wasteful: they clutter up your feature files and slow down feedback.
