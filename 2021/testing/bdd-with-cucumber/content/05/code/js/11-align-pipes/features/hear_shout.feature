Feature: Hear shout

  Shouty allows users to "hear" other users "shouts" as long as they are close enough to each other.

      Given a person named Sean
      And a person named Lucy

      And people are located at
        | name | location |
        | Sean | 0        |
        | Lucy | 50       |
      When Sean shouts
      Then Lucy should hear a shout
