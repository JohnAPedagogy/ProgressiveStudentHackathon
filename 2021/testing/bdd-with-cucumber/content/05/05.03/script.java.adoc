Let's look at the two scenarios that illustrate the rule about range again shot::[1,"show the range rule & scenarios"]. Notice how the steps that create the Sean,shot::[2] Lucy,shot::[3] and Larry shot::[4] are very similar.

When we see steps like this, Gherkin’s Given When Then syntax starts to feel a bit clunky. Imagine if we could just write out a table, like this:

shot::[5,feature file]

.hear_shout.feature
[source,gherkin]

include::../code/java/05--step05-location-specified-in-data-table/shouty/src/test/resources/shouty/hear_shout.feature[lines=17..20]
----

Well, we’re in luck. You can!

Gherkin has a special syntax called Data Tables, that allows you to specify tabular data for a step, using pipe characters to mark the boundary between cells. shot::[6, highlight data table]

shot::[7,"run cucumber"]shot::[8,"copy snippet, paste into StepDefinition.java"]

.StepDefinitions.java

include::../code/java/06--step06-table-snippet-added/shouty/src/test/java/shouty/StepDefinitions.java[lines=45..55]
----

As you can see, the step definition implicitly takes a single argument shot::[9,"highlight stepdef parameters"], which as this comment explains is a DataTable. shot::[10,"highlight comment"] This object has a rich API for using the tabular data.

At its most basic, the table is just a two-dimensional array. So, Lucy's location can be accessed by getting the value from array cell (2, 1)  shot::[11,"Print out a single cell value"]

.StepDefinitions.java

include::../code/java/07--step07-use-cell-to-demonstrate-a-2d-array/shouty/src/test/java/shouty/StepDefinitions.java[lines=45..48]
----

shot::[12,"run Cucumber, highlight 'Lucy's location'"]

You can also turn the table into a List of Maps shot::[13,"Print out data table"], where the first row is used for the map keys, shot::[14,"split IntelliJ screen horizontally, showing feature file at top and stepdefs below. Highlight first row"] and each following row is used for the map values. shot::[15,"Highlight second & third rows"]

shot::[16,"run Cucumber, highlight data table output"]

Now we can easily iterate shot::[17,"write the loop"] over these maps and turn them into instances of Person: shot::[18]

shot::[19,"run cucumber -- all green"]

With that done, we can update the other scenario shot::[20,"update other scenario"] ...

include::../code/java/10--step10-changed-other-scenario-and-deleted-unused-stepdef/shouty/src/test/resources/shouty/hear_shout.feature[lines=24..31]

Now we can check that everything is still green. shot::[21]

and delete our old step definition, which is now unused.  shot::[22,"delete unused step def"]

shot::[23,"run cucumber"]

Cucumber strips all the white space surrounding each cell shot::[24,"show lining up of pipe characters"], so we can have a nice neat table in the Gherkin but still get clean values in the step definition underneath.

Notice we’ve still had to convert the location from a string to an integer shot::[25,"Conversion in step def"], because Cucumber can’t know that’s the type of value in our table.

To improve the readability and maintainability of your step definition you can have Cucumber automatically convert the table into a list of any class you want. If our Person object had a name field we could automatically create instances of Person from this table. But things aren’t always that simple.

Instead, we’ll define a simple Whereabouts class to represent the data in the table. shot::[26,"creates the class"]

.StepDefinitions.java
[source,java]
----
include::../code/java/11--step11-use-whereabouts-class/shouty/src/test/java/shouty/StepDefinitions.java[lines=27..35]
----

We’ve made it an inner class to the step definition class, as it doesn’t form part of our core domain.

Then we can shot::[27,"write defineWhereabouts()"] create a method annotated with @DataTableType so that Cucumber knows how to convert the table into a list of Whereabouts objects.

Now, if you declare your table parameter as a generic list shot::[28,"modify stepdef"], Cucumber will automatically convert the table into a list of the generic type for you.

shot::[29,"Run Cucumber"]
Let's run Cucumber to check that we're still green. And we are!

shot::[30,"hear_shout.feature data tables"]
That looks much nicer -  people positioned using a table in the feature file and shot::[31,"people_are_located_at()"] really clean code that creates and positions people according to the data.
